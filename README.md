INTRODUCTION

   This project is about an online platform to sell innovative projects of young researchers and also this will allow researchers to get funds from investors. Using those     investments researchers can develop their new inventions. That is the main idea of this GadgetBadget system. 

   There are four main functions that we hope to develop in this system. These are User management, Product management, Fund management and Research document management.
This system will manage all the above-mentioned features with all the crud functions. This will definitely help for young innovators to achieve their goals.
